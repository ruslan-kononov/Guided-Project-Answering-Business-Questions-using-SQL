# Answering Business Questions using SQL
***
## Motivation
This project aims to demonstrate my SQL skills acquired due to SQL online courses that are a part of the Dataquest's <a href='https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/'>Data Science in Python</a> track.
## Description
In this project, I will be working with a modified version of a database called <a href='https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database'>Chinook</a>. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop that structurally may resemble a mini-iTunes store.

The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers' purchases. This information is contained in __11 tables__. A schema diagram for the Chinook database below gives an overview of the available columns and the structure of the data:
